Install libraries and build applications
=========================================

There are some simple scripts provided in the scripts/ directory whose execution
can be automated using the provided Makefile.

* make clone
    Running this will clone all of the necessary repos to the correct location.

* make update
    Running this will update all repositories to the latest version.

    NOTE: You must run 'make clone' prior to running 'make update'

* make install
    Running this will install the necessary libraries for building the client
    and server applications. This assumes an up-to-date version of the
    Haskell platform installed on the system.

    NOTE: You must run 'make clone' prior to running 'make install'

* make build
    Running this will build the client and broker, and install symlinks to the applications
    that can be run from this directory: broker and client

    NOTE: You must run 'make install' prior to running 'make build'

* make clean
    Running this will clean up build artifacts in the working directory. It does not
    clean out any of the sub-repositories that are checked out via 'make clone'.

* make destroy
    Runs a 'make clean' and additionally removes all of the cloned repositories.

    NOTE: This does NOT uninstall the libraries from your system.

Build artifacts
================

* The following executable binaries are placed in the bin/ directory on 'make build'
    + broker - A STOMP broker
    + client - A CLI STOMP client
    + producer - A simple producer client
    + consumer - A simple consumer client

Initialize the message broker
=============================

broker [port]

Initialize the CLI client application
=====================================

client

Using the CLI client application
================================
connect localhost [port]
