Install libraries and build applications
=========================================

There are some simple scripts provided in the scripts/ directory whose execution
can be automated using the provided Makefile.

* make clone
    Running this will clone all of the necessary repos to the correct location.

* make install
    Running this will install the necessary libraries for building the client
    and server applications. This assumes an up-to-date version of the
    Haskell platform installed on the system.

    NOTE: You must run 'make clone' prior to running 'make install'

* make build
    Running this will build the client and broker, and install symlinks to the applications
    that can be run from this directory: broker and client

    NOTE: You must run 'make install' prior to running 'make build'
